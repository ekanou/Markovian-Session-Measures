# Markovian-Session-Measures
A Markovian Approach to Evaluate Session-based IR Systems

We investigate a new approach for evaluating session-based
information retrieval systems, based on Markov chains. In particular, we
develop a new family of evaluation measures, inspired by random walks,
which account for the probability of moving to the next and previous
documents in a result list, to the next query in a session, and to the
end of the session. We leverage this Markov chain to substitute what in
existing measures is a fixed discount linked to the rank of a document or
to the position of a query in a session with a stochastic average time to
reach a document and the probability of actually reaching a given query.
We experimentally compare our new family of measures with existing
measures - namely, session DCG, Cube Test, and Expected Utility -
over the TREC Dynamic Domain track, showing the  flexibility of the 
proposed measures and the transparency in modeling the user dynamics.
